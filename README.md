Encrypted Chatroom CC2 Project
Run the server, then run the client
you might need to install the cryptography package pip3 install cryptography
to allow people in your local area network to connect, you need to enter the server’s ip address (on Mac, at least, I go to network settings to get it for windows it’s ipconfig in command prompt) to just host the server on your computer type yes
Enter the encryption key (you will have to generate it using keygenerate.py) or you can just use this one I already generated -C0cIzOTOFunrzQJ60PqGjJYBqLvCk3tAAmaxo8LljM=
Make sure all clients are using the same encryption key
